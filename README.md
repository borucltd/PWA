# PWA Budget Tracker

Exercise to create progressive web app. To the existsing project I added webmanifest, service-provider and javascript file to manage indexDB.
All components were tied together. 

# How it works

Once the application is in Offline state it is still functional. It saves user's data in cache indexDB. In background, connection to mongodb (Heroku) is being checked. Once the application is in Online state, all records from indexDB are automatically transfered to mongodb.


# Installation
Click "+" sign and install the application as standard PWA.
